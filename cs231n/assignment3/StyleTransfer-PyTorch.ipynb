    "The general idea is to take two images, and produce a new image that reflects the content of one but the artistic \"style\" of the other. We will do this by first formulating a loss function that matches the content and style of each respective image in the feature space of a deep network, and then performing gradient descent on the pixels of the image itself.\n",

    "The deep network we use as a feature extractor is [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360), a small model that has been trained on ImageNet. You could use any network, but we chose SqueezeNet here for its small size and efficiency.\n",

We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let $F^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C_\\ell \\times M_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the current image and $P^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C_\\ell \\times M_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the content source image where $M_\\ell=H_\\ell\\times W_\\ell$ is the number of elements in each feature map.

    "The code you've written can do another cool thing. In an attempt to understand the types of features that convolutional networks learn to recognize, a recent paper \"[Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0035.pdf)\" attempts to reconstruct an image from its feature representation. We can easily implement this idea using image gradients from the pretrained network, which is exactly what we did above (but with two different feature representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you set the style weights to all be 0 and initialize the starting image to random noise instead of the content source image, you'll reconstruct an image from the feature representation of the content source image. You're starting with total noise, but you should end up with something that looks quite a bit like your original image.\n",
