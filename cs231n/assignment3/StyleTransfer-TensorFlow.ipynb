    "The general idea is to take two images, and produce a new image that reflects the content of one but the artistic \"style\" of the other.

We can then use this hybrid loss function to perform gradient descent **not on the parameters** of the model, but instead **on the pixel values** of our original image.\n",

We only care about the content representation of one layer of the network (say, layer $\\ell$), that has feature maps $A^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times H_\\ell \\times W_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$. $C_\\ell$ is the number of filters/channels in layer $\\ell$, $H_\\ell$ and $W_\\ell$ are the height and width. We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let $F^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the current image and $P^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the content source image where $M_\\ell=H_\\ell\\times W_\\ell$ is the number of elements in each feature map. Each row of $F^\\ell$ or $P^\\ell$ represents the vectorized activations of a particular filter, convolved over all positions of the image.

    "* `style_weights` specifies a list of weights to use for each layer in style_layers (each of which will contribute a term to the overall style loss). We generally use higher weights for the earlier style layers because they describe more local/smaller scale features, which are more important to texture than features over larger receptive fields. In general, increasing these weights will make the resulting image look less like the original content and more distorted towards the appearance of the style image.\n",

    "The code you've written can do another cool thing. In an attempt to understand the types of features that convolutional networks learn to recognize, a recent paper \"[Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0035.pdf)\" attempts to reconstruct an image from its feature representation. We can easily implement this idea using image gradients from the pretrained network, which is exactly what we did above (but with two different feature representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you set the style weights to all be 0 and initialize the starting image to random noise instead of the content source image, you'll reconstruct an image from the feature representation of the content source image. You're starting with total noise, but you should end up with something that looks quite a bit like your original image.\n",
