    "In the previous notebook, we mentioned that Layer Normalization is an alternative normalization technique that mitigates the batch size limitations of Batch Normalization. However, as the authors of [2] observed, Layer Normalization does not perform as well as Batch Normalization when used with Convolutional Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    ">With fully connected layers, all the hidden units in a layer tend to make similar contributions to the final prediction, and re-centering and rescaling the summed inputs to a layer works well. However, the assumption of similar contributions is no longer true for convolutional neural networks. The large number of the hidden units whose\n",
    "receptive fields lie near the boundary of the image are rarely turned on and thus have very different\n",
    "statistics from the rest of the hidden units within the same layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [3] propose an intermediary technique. In contrast to Layer Normalization, where you normalize over the entire feature per-datapoint, they suggest a consistent splitting of each per-datapoint feature into G groups, and a per-group per-datapoint normalization instead. \n",

    "\n",
    "Even though an assumption of equal contribution is still being made within each group, the authors hypothesize that this is not as problematic, as innate grouping arises within features for visual recognition. One example they use to illustrate this is that many high-performance handcrafted features in traditional Computer Vision have terms that are explicitly grouped together. Take for example Histogram of Oriented Gradients [4]-- after computing histograms per spatially local block, each per-block histogram is normalized before being concatenated together to form the final feature vector.\n",
